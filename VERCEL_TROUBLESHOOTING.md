# 🔧 Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## ✅ Latest Status
- **GitHub**: All fixes pushed to commit `7e5a01c`
- **Fixes Applied**: All linting errors resolved
- **Ready**: Should deploy successfully now

## 🚀 If Vercel Still Shows Old Build

### Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
- Vercel should automatically detect the new commit
- Check your Vercel dashboard in 2-3 minutes
- Look for a new deployment starting

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Find your project**: `QuickNewsLandingPage`
3. **Go to "Deployments" tab**
4. **Click "Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
5. **Select "Use existing Build Cache"**: NO
6. **Click "Redeploy"**

### Option 3: Force New Deployment
1. **In Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Go to "Settings" → "Git"**
3. **Click "Disconnect"** then **"Connect"** again
4. **This forces a fresh deployment**

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Successful Build Should Show:
```
✓ Compiled successfully in 9.9s
✓ Linting and checking validity of types ...
✓ Build completed successfully
```

### ❌ Old Errors (Should Be Gone):
- ~~`Do not use an <a> element to navigate to /`~~
- ~~`'` can be escaped with `&apos;`~~
- ~~`'Button' is defined but never used`~~

## 🎯 Expected Result
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful
